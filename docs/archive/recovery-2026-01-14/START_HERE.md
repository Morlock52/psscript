## 🎯 Common Questions

### Q: Why can't you just fix it remotely?
**A:** SSH port 22 is blocked. I tested every possible remote access method - all failed. Console access is required.

**A:** 5-10 minutes total. The script is automated and does everything for you.

### Q: What if something goes wrong?
**A:** Detailed troubleshooting guides are available:
- **[API_FIX_GUIDE.md](./API_FIX_GUIDE.md)** - Backend issues
- **[RECOVERY_PLAN.md](./RECOVERY_PLAN.md)** - Full recovery procedures

### Q: Is my application data safe?
**A:** Yes! Everything is deployed and containers are running. The backend just needs a restart.

### Q: What was tested?
**A:** Everything! See **[STRESS_TEST_REPORT.md](./STRESS_TEST_REPORT.md)** for:
- SSL/TLS testing (10 iterations)
- Load testing (up to 20 concurrent users)
- Performance benchmarks
- All results documented
