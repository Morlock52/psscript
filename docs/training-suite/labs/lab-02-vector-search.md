# Lab 02: Vector Search and Similarity

## Goal

Use vector search to locate scripts that are similar to a target script.

## Steps

1. Open a script detail page.
2. Trigger similarity search or use the search page.
3. Compare the top three results.
4. Record which script is most relevant and why.

## Expected results

- Similar scripts are returned based on content
- Results improve when tags and categories are applied

## Troubleshooting

- Confirm pgvector is installed in Postgres
- Ensure embeddings have been generated for scripts
