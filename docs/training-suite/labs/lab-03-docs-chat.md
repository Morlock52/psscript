# Lab 03: Documentation and AI Chat

## Goal

Use the documentation explorer and AI chat to answer a script question.

## Steps

1. Open Documentation and search for a PowerShell cmdlet.
2. Copy a relevant example into your notes.
3. Open AI Chat and ask for a safe usage pattern.
4. Compare the response to the documentation.

## Expected results

- Documentation results show relevant cmdlets
- Chat response includes safety guidance or best practices

## Troubleshooting

- If search results are empty, check the documentation crawler status
- If chat responses fail, verify AI service or mock mode
