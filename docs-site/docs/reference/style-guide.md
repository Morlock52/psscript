# Documentation style guide

Use this guide when adding or updating documentation.

## Lists and whitespace

Introduce lists with a complete sentence and use parallel structure.

- Add one blank line before lists.
- Do not add blank lines between list items unless an item has multiple paragraphs.
- Use ordered lists for sequences and unordered lists for collections.
- Keep capitalization consistent within a list.

## Tone and structure

- Write for developers and operators.
- Start with a short overview.
- Prefer short sections with meaningful headings.
- Use consistent terminology across docs.

## Images and accessibility

- Use images only when they add value beyond text.
- Provide descriptive alt text for informative images.
- Use empty alt text for decorative images.
- Prefer SVG for diagrams and PNG for screenshots.
- Crop screenshots to relevant UI regions.
